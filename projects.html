          <img src="pictures/filmeDB.gif" alt="">
          <p>
            This film management software allows you to view, add, edit
            and delete films.<br /><br />
            There is also a button at the bottom left that allows you to switch
            between dark and light mode.<br /><br />
            All films that have been added are stored in an SQL database.<br /><br />

          <img src="pictures/blue-dragon.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            At the beginning of the game, you can choose a weapon.<br /><br />
            After that, new enemies appear repeatedly. After defeating
            ten enemies, you advance to the next world.<br /><br />
            When you defeat an enemy, you have a 20% chance of receiving a
            healing potion.<br /><br />
            The game ends when you die or have survived all worlds.<br /><br />

          <h2>Tamagotchi</h2>
          <img src="pictures/tamagotchi.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            In this game, you have your own Tamagotchi that you have to
            take care of.<br /><br />
            You have to feed it, let it play and put it to sleep. To feed
            it, you have to keep fishing for fish.<br /><br />
            If you don't take care of your Tamagotchi, it will become sad
            and may even die.<br /><br />

          <img src="pictures/snake.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            In my Snake game, you can play Snake. You can control the white
            snake using the WASD keys.<br /><br />
            As soon as the snake eats a red fruit, your high score increases
            by one and the snake becomes one pixel longer.<br /><br />
            As soon as you hit the wall, the game is over.<br /><br />

            On this website, you can find out everything you need to know
            about Japan.<br /><br />
            There is information about the regions, the writing system,
            the animals and the cuisine.<br /><br />
            Each page also features an interesting ‘Did you know?’ section.<br /><br />
